# Reads config from ./credentials file
# Takes standard input in CSV (separated with ",")
# For each line of input takes first field (email),
#   then looks up the corresponding uid in a LDAP
#   and then appends it as a last column
# I.e.:
# name.surname@example.com,whatever,, -> name.surname@example.com,whatever,,,nsurname
# Example run:
# $ cat usernames.csv | tail -n +2 | ./ldap.sh
# Config example:
# UNAME=[username]
# PASS=[password]
# HOST="ldaps://ldap.example"
# BASE_DN="ou=whatever,dc=example,dc=com"
